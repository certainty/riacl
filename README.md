# Riak inspired key-value store in Common Lisp

For me one of the best ways to learn about difficult concepts is to reimplement
the wheel and re-implement existing solutions. Riak was one of the early distributed systems
that applied the principles described in the dynamo paper. This was cutting edge distributed 
systems engineering back then.

So it is one thing to know the theory if a system and a totally different thing to actually go
and implement it. The latter provides plenty of opportunity to test how well one really understands 
how everything works together. This is what I do here. Implement a riak inspired BASE system using 
my current weapon of choice, Common Lisp.
